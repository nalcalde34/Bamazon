# Bamazon Node App

The Bamazon node app allows users to select from a variety of products in the terminal and choose a quantity they would like to order. The app will then check the SQL database (where all of the product information is stored) and see if the requested quantity is available. If the requested amount is available, the order will be completed and if not the user will get an error and be prompted to select a new product or different quantity. 

**Example of a user successfully ordering a product.**

**Example of a user requesting an amount that is greater than the current stock quantity.**
